    \begin{itemize*}
    \item Led research on the uncharacterized \emph{E. coli}
      DNA damage response gene \emph{ybfeE}. Developed
      the protocols necessary for the expression and
      purification of the protein, and confirmed a
      computation prediction of DNA binding using
      \emph{in vitro} methods. Structurally
      characterized the protein using site-directed
      mutagenesis, circular dichroism, and molecular
      modeling (YASARA). Conducted \emph{in vivo} assays
      to characterize the gene's role in regulation of
      the DNA damage response, mutagenicity, and stress
      response.
    \item Investigated the putative Y-family DNA polymerase
      DinB from \emph{S. meliloti} through expression in
      \emph{E. coli}. Cloned gene into pET expression
      vector and developed expression and purification
      methods to troubleshoot problems with protein
      solubility and acquire viable protein for
      characterization. Assayed protein activity by
      primer extension assays.
    \item Prepared damaged DNA samples for LC-MS
      characterization of adducts caused by
      \emph{in vivo} vs. \emph{in vitro} by nitrofurazone and
      benzyl bromide.
    \item Mentored and trained undergraduate students in the
      lab.

    \item Participated in development work, production, and quality
      control of a 49 million member purine-scaffold library using
      ELT (Encoded Library Technology).
    \item Ensured general reaction scheme was valid prior to library
      production.
    \item Checked that litigation of DNA tags was not impeded by other
      reactants.
    \item Determined the scope of reactive chemical building blocks to
      be used in production.
